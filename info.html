                    <h2>Driving Under the Influence in Arizona.</h2>
                    <p>It is unlawful for any person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or
                        any drugs to drive or be in actual physical control of any vehicle.</p>
                    <p>When you apply for and accept the privilege to drive a vehicle in Arizona, you give consent to test
                        for blood alcohol concentration or drug content (BADC) if you are arrested for driving while under
                        the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs (DUI). This is known as the Implied Consent Law.</p>
                    <p>When a law enforcement officer has reason to believe you have been driving while under the influence,
                        the officer will request that you submit to a BADC test of your blood, breath, urine or other bodily
                        substance to measure the amount of alcohol or drugs present in your bloodstream.</p>

                    <h3 id="penalties">DUI Penalties</h3>
                    <p>If you are stopped for driving under the influence and a test shows that you have an alcohol
                        concentration of 0.08 percent or more (0.04 in a commercial vehicle requiring a commercial driver
                        license), or if a blood alcohol or drug test result is not available, you will lose your driving privilege on
                        the spot. In addition, you will be required to complete alcohol or drug screening before you can obtain a
                        restricted permit or reinstate your driving privilege.</p>
                    <p>You may be found guilty of driving while intoxicated or while under the influence of any drug or its
                        metabolite even though the blood alcohol concentration was less than 0.08 percent. If you are under 21,
                        your license may be suspended if there is any alcohol concentration.</p>
                    <p>If you refuse to submit to or do not successfully complete any tests when you are arrested for driving
                        under the influence, you will automatically lose your driving privilege for 12 months or 24 months for a
                        second refusal within 84 months. In addition, you will be required to complete alcohol or drug screening
                        before you can obtain a restricted permit or reinstate your driving privilege.</p>
                    <p>In addition to any criminal penalties imposed by the court for a second or third offense DUI violation,
                        your driving privilege will be automatically revoked.</p>

                    <h3 id="dui">DUI</h3>
                    <p><strong> First offense:</strong> You will be jailed for not less than 10 consecutive days and
                        fined not less than $1,250. You will also be required to undergo alcohol screening/education/treatment
                        and to equip any vehicle you operate with a certified ignition interlock device, and be ordered
                        to perform community service.</p>
                    <p><strong> Second and subsequent offenses:</strong> You will be jailed for not less than 90 days
                        and fined not less than $3,000 and your license will be revoked for 12 months. You will also be
                        required to undergo alcohol screening/education/treatment and to equip any vehicle you operate
                        with a certified ignition interlock device, and be ordered to perform community service.</p>

                    <h3 id="extreme">Extreme DUI</h3>
                    <p>This category of DUI applies to a person with an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or higher.</p>
                    <p><strong> First offense:</strong> You will be jailed for not less than 30 consecutive days with
                        no eligibility for probation or suspended sentence and fined not less than $2,500. You will also
                        be required to undergo alcohol screening/education/treatment and be ordered to perform community
                        service and to equip any vehicle you operate with a certified ignition interlock device.</p>

                        law, your license will be revoked for one year. You will also be required to undergo alcohol
                        screening/education/treatment and to equip any vehicle you operate with a certified ignition interlock

                    <p>When Arizona law mandates use of an interlock following a period of driver license
                        suspension/revocation, you must have one installed by an MVD-authorized company and provide proof
                        of the installation.</p>
                    <p>MVD uses special forms and procedures to monitor drivers required to have the device installed. You
                        may be issued a replacement driver license containing the words "Ignition Interlock" and mark your
                        record so that law-enforcement officers will be aware of the interlock requirement if you are stopped.</p>
                    <p><strong>Please Note: Your Arizona Driving Privileges must be reinstated in order to establish a starting point for
                        your required ignition interlock time frame. To reinstate, please visit an MVD or Authorized Third Party
                        office.</strong></p>

                    <h3 id="ciid">Certified Ignition Interlock Device</h3>
                    <p>A certified ignition interlock device is a breath alcohol testing instrument connected to the ignition and
                        power system of the vehicle. The driver blows into the device before attempting to turn the ignition. If
                        the driver’s alcohol level is above a certain level, the vehicle will not start. While the vehicle is operating,
                        the driver must blow into the device at random intervals.</p>
